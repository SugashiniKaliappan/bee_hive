# Group Name 
  Group 6

# Project Title
  Design the system architecture. To implement the DevOps pipelines, you are required to use “Agile” methodology

# Research Objectives
  - With the inspiration of “October—Pink Month,” we selected the topic of accurately predicting Breast Cancer using machine learning.
  - A project to develop a system for a tertiary care hospital that serves approximately 2000 patients daily.
  - There are three entry routes for patients depending on their health conditions.
  - Patients needing urgent attention are admitted to the hospital through Accident and Emergency (A&E) Department.
  - Patients visit the Outdoor Patient Department (OPD) for their routine checkup
  - on a pre-booked appointment or on a first come first serve basis.
  - There is a total of 36 wards which are operational under 9 departments including Medicine, Surgery,Orthopedics, Pediatrics, ENT, Ophthalmology, Gynecology, Dermatology and Oncology.
  - Each department has 4 wards e.g., Surgery Department has Surgical A, Surgical B, Surgical C, and Surgical D. There are two special wards for critical patients i.e., Cardiology Care Unit (CCU) and Intensive Care Units (ICU).
  - Patients that require monitoring, care and specialized treatment are admitted to the above wards through OPD or A&E.
